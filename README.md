As you can see, the folder that holds all the files in this repository is named pa7submit. This was actually a PA for one of my CSE courses at UCSD.
This assignment was given in order to give an in depth understanding of the BST data structure as well as defaultMaps.
An additional part of this assignment was to show how this method of storing data can be applied to file systems.
If you would like to reproduce this, simply clone the repository and alter the BSTTest java file to your desire to test out the BST.
If you want to test out the File System that I made, alter the FileSystemTest java file.
